### Topics
- **Graph Algorithms**: This includes Dijkstra's Algorithm, which is used for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph, and Kruskal's Algorithm, which is used to find the minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph.

- **Greedy Algorithms**: This refers to a problem-solving technique that makes locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.

- **Fractional Knapsack Problem**: This is a variation of the knapsack problem where you can take fractions of items, making it solvable by greedy strategies.

- **Matrix Multiplication**: Specifically, Strassen's Matrix Multiplication, which is an efficient algorithm for multiplying large matrices.

- **Divide and Conquer Algorithms**: This is a strategy that breaks a problem into smaller sub-problems, solves each sub-problem recursively, and then combines the solutions to solve the original problem.

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Including the 2 Way Merge Sort, which is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input list into two halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together to produce a sorted list.
