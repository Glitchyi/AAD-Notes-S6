### Topics
- **Dynamic Programming**: This is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

- **Matrix Chain Multiplication**: This is a specific instance of dynamic programming that deals with determining the most efficient way to multiply a chain of matrices together.

- **Branch and Bound**: This is an algorithm design paradigm for discrete and combinatorial optimization problems, as well as mathematical optimization. It involves enumerating candidate solutions and using bounding functions to eliminate suboptimal solutions.

- **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: This is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science and operations research. It focuses on optimization, where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of locations exactly once and returns to the origin point.

- **Backtracking**: This is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point during the problem-solving process.

- **N-Queens Problem**: This is a classic backtracking problem that involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
