## Dijkstra's Algorithm for Shortest Path

Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the shortest path between a source vertex and all other vertices in a weighted graph. It is widely used in various applications, such as network routing protocols, GPS navigation systems, and social network analysis.

### Algorithm

The algorithm works by maintaining a set of visited vertices and a set of unvisited vertices. It iteratively selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance from the source and updates the distances of its neighboring vertices if a shorter path is found.

### Visualization

To visualize and remember the steps of Dijkstra's algorithm, we can use a table format:

| Vertex | Distance | Previous | Status |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
|   A    |    0     |    -     | Visited |
|   B    |    4     |    A     | Unvisited |
|   C    |    2     |    A     | Visited |
|   D    |    3     |    C     | Visited |
|   E    |    7     |    C     | Unvisited |
|   F    |    5     |    C     | Visited |

In this table:

1. The first column represents the vertices in the graph.
2. The second column shows the current distance from the source vertex (in this case, vertex A) to each vertex.
3. The third column indicates the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source to the current vertex.
4. The fourth column represents the status of the vertex, either "Visited" or "Unvisited."

Here's how the algorithm progresses:

1. Initially, the source vertex A has a distance of 0, and all other vertices have an infinite distance.
2. The algorithm starts by visiting vertex A and updates the distances of its neighboring vertices (B and C) if a shorter path is found.
3. Next, the algorithm selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance, which is vertex C, and marks it as visited.
4. The distances of C's neighboring vertices (D and F) are updated if a shorter path is found through C.
5. The algorithm then selects the next unvisited vertex with the smallest distance, which is vertex D, and marks it as visited.
6. The process continues until all vertices have been visited or there are no more unvisited vertices reachable from the source.

By visualizing the algorithm using this table, you can easily understand the process of updating distances, tracking previous vertices in the shortest path, and marking vertices as visited or unvisited.

The table also helps you remember the key aspects of Dijkstra's algorithm, such as:

- The source vertex has a distance of 0.
- Vertices are visited in order of their distances from the source.
- Distances are updated only if a shorter path is found.
- The "Previous" column keeps track of the previous vertex in the shortest path.

This visualization technique can aid in understanding and implementing Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths in weighted graphs.
