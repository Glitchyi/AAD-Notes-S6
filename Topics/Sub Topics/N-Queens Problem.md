## Introduction

The N-Queens problem is a classic constraint satisfaction problem in computer science and mathematics. The objective is to place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other, meaning they cannot be in the same row, column, or diagonal. This problem has applications in various fields, including scheduling, circuit design, and parallel processing. 

## Algorithm

One common approach to solving the N-Queens problem is using backtracking. Here's a high-level pseudocode for the backtracking algorithm:

```pseudo
function solveNQueens(n):
    board = create an n×n board filled with '.'
    solutions = []
    
    def isSafe(board, row, col):
        # Check if a queen can be placed on board[row][col]
        # by checking rows, columns, and diagonals
        return True  # If the position is safe
    
    def placeQueens(board, row):
        # Base case: If all queens are placed, add the solution to solutions 
		# If you are on the Nth row it means you have completed 
        if row == n:
            solutions.append(copy(board))
            return
        
        # Place this queen in all safe positions in the current row
        for col in range(n):
            if isSafe(board, row, col):
                board[row][col] = 'Q'  # Place the queen
                
                # Move to the next row
                placeQueens(board, row + 1)
                
                board[row][col] = '.'  # Backtrack (remove the queen)
    
    placeQueens(board, 0)  # Start with the first row
    return solutions
```

## Explanation

The `solveNQueens` function initializes an empty board and a list to store solutions. It then calls the `placeQueens` function with the first row (0).

The `placeQueens` function is a recursive function that tries to place a queen in each row. It iterates over the columns in the current row and checks if it's safe to place a queen at that position using the `isSafe` function. If it's safe, the queen is placed, and the function recursively moves to the next row. If all queens are placed successfully (base case), the solution is added to the `solutions` list.

If a queen cannot be placed in any column of the current row, the function backtracks by removing the previously placed queen and trying a different position.

The `isSafe` function checks if a queen can be placed at a given position by verifying that no other queens are present in the same row, column, or diagonal. This function needs to be implemented based on the specific requirements of the problem.

The time complexity of this backtracking algorithm is O(N!), as it explores all possible permutations of queen placements. However, various optimization techniques, such as constraint propagation and heuristics, can be employed to improve the performance.
