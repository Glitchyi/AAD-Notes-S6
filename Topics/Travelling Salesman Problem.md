## Introduction

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science and operations research. It focuses on optimization and is defined as follows: given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city? TSP is known for its computational complexity, as it is an NP-hard problem, meaning that no polynomial-time solution is known for the general case.

## Algorithm

The following is a pseudocode for a brute-force approach to the Traveling Salesman Problem, which is not efficient for large datasets but illustrates the concept:

```pseudo
function TravelingSalesmanProblem(distances):
    n = number of cities
    cities = list of all cities
    min_route = permutation of cities with the minimum distance
    min_distance = infinity

    for each permutation p of cities:
        current_distance = 0
        for i from 0 to n-2:
            current_distance += distances[p[i]][p[i+1]]
        current_distance += distances[p[n-1]][p[0]] // return to the starting city

        if current_distance < min_distance:
            min_distance = current_distance
            min_route = p

    return min_route, min_distance
```

## Explanation

The brute-force algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem generates all possible permutations of the cities (routes) and calculates the total distance for each permutation. The steps are as follows:

1. **Initialization**: Set the minimum distance to infinity and initialize an empty list to store the minimum route.

2. **Permutation Generation**: Generate all possible permutations of the list of cities. Each permutation represents a unique order in which the cities could be visited.

3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, calculate the total distance of the route by summing the distances between consecutive cities in the permutation, including the return trip to the starting city.

4. **Minimum Distance Update**: If the total distance of the current permutation is less than the current minimum distance, update the minimum distance and record the current permutation as the new minimum route.

5. **Result**: After all permutations have been evaluated, the algorithm returns the permutation with the minimum total distance, which represents the shortest route, along with the length of that route.

This brute-force approach has a factorial time complexity of $$O(n!)$$, which becomes infeasible to solve as the number of cities increases. Therefore, for larger instances of TSP, various heuristics and approximation algorithms, such as the nearest neighbor, branch and bound, and genetic algorithms, are used to find solutions that are good enough within a reasonable amount of time.
