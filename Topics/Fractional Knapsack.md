## Fractional Knapsack Problem

The Fractional Knapsack Problem is a variation of the classic Knapsack Problem, where items can be divided into fractions. The goal is to maximize the total value of items that can be placed in a knapsack with a given weight capacity.

### Algorithm

The Fractional Knapsack Problem can be solved using a greedy approach by following these steps:

1. Calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item.
2. Sort the items in descending order based on their value-to-weight ratios.
3. Start with an empty knapsack and iterate through the sorted items.
4. For each item, add as much of the item as possible to the knapsack without exceeding the weight capacity.
5. If the entire item can fit, add it to the knapsack; otherwise, add a fraction of the item that can fit.
6. Repeat step 4 and 5 until the knapsack is full or all items have been considered.

### Visualization

To help visualize and remember the algorithm, we can create a table with the following columns:

| Item | Value | Weight | Value/Weight Ratio | Fraction Taken |
|------|-------|--------|---------------------|----------------|
|   A  |   60  |   10   |         6          |       1        |
|   B  |   100 |   20   |         5          |       1        |
|   C  |   120 |   30   |         4          |       0.5      |
|   D  |   40  |   10   |         4          |       0        |

Here's how the table can be interpreted:

1. The first three columns represent the item, its value, and its weight, respectively.
2. The fourth column shows the value-to-weight ratio for each item, calculated by dividing the value by the weight.
3. The items are sorted in descending order based on their value-to-weight ratios.
4. The fifth column, "Fraction Taken," represents the fraction of the item that should be included in the knapsack.
5. In the example, items A and B are fully included (fraction taken = 1) because they can fit entirely in the knapsack.
6. For item C, only half of it (fraction taken = 0.5) can be included due to the weight capacity constraint.
7. Item D is not included (fraction taken = 0) because the knapsack is already full after including items A, B, and a fraction of C.

By visualizing the problem using this table, you can easily understand the greedy approach and the rationale behind selecting items based on their value-to-weight ratios. The "Fraction Taken" column helps illustrate how items can be partially included in the knapsack when necessary.
